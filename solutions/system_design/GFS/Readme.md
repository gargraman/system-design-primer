The Google File System (GFS) boasts a distributed architecture designed for scalability, fault tolerance, and high performance for massive datasets. Here's a breakdown of its key components:

**1. Master Server:**

* Single point of control for the entire GFS cluster.
* Manages file system metadata: tracks file creation, deletion, access control lists, and the location of data chunks.
* Assigns unique identifiers to files and chunks.
* Grants leases to clients for read/write access to specific chunks.
* Monitors chunk servers and maintains their health information.

**2. Chunk Servers:**

* Multiple commodity servers storing the actual file data.
* Each chunk (typically 64MB) is replicated across multiple chunk servers for redundancy. 
* Clients communicate directly with chunk servers for data reads and writes.
* Report their health status and available storage to the master server periodically.

**3. Clients:**

*  Run on machines that need access to GFS data (e.g., Google Search servers).
* Interact with the master server for file system operations like creating, opening, and deleting files. 
* Obtain leases from the master server for read/write access to specific data chunks. 
* Communicate directly with chunk servers for data transfer. 
* Can cache frequently accessed metadata and chunk locations for faster access.

**Data Management:**

* **Chunking:** Files are divided into fixed-size chunks, allowing for parallel processing and efficient network transfers.
* **Replication:** Each chunk is replicated across multiple chunk servers to ensure data availability even during server failures. GFS typically replicates chunks at least three times.
* **Leases:** Clients acquire leases from the master server for read/write access to specific chunks. This mechanism ensures exclusive access and prevents conflicts during concurrent modifications.

**Consistency Model:**

* GFS employs a relaxed consistency model, prioritizing availability over strict consistency.
* Writes are propagated asynchronously across replicas, meaning changes might not be immediately reflected on all copies.
* Versioning is used to identify stale replicas. Clients and chunk servers verify version numbers before performing operations, ensuring data consistency within a reasonable timeframe.

**Benefits:**

* **Scalability:** GFS can easily scale by adding more chunk servers to the cluster.
* **Fault Tolerance:** Data redundancy through replication ensures file accessibility even with server failures.
* **High Performance:** Large chunk size and parallel processing enable efficient data transfer for large files.
* **Availability:** Relaxed consistency model prioritizes data availability over strict consistency for high uptime.

**Limitations:**

* **Single Point of Failure:** The master server is a critical component, and its failure can disrupt file system operations. (Later versions of GFS addressed this with redundancy mechanisms for the master server)
* **Not ideal for small files:** GFS is optimized for large files, and managing numerous small files can be less efficient. 

**While GFS is not the most recent technology within Google, understanding its design principles is valuable for anyone interested in distributed file systems and big data management.**
